The main purpose of this project is to show pictures on a TV. It also shows some other interresting data. 
In the top left it shows the date when the photo was taken, if its available in the Exif data. To the right it shows 
the current time and data from Emoncms temperature/humidity sensors. Below this is an agenda with data 
from Google Calendar. Finally, at the bottom, it shows metrological data from swedish weather institute Smhi. 
The main file is showpics.html. In this file we call php files who collects data, and also javascript/Jquery code to
collect data from various sources. 
pics.php is the script that get the photos. The content in a dir is listed, and a random image is selected. The script 
also collects som Exif data from the file. All this is then returned as Json. 
smhidata.php. This script collects weather data from a nearby weather station. We find info about the current weather, 
upcoming weather and more. Weather codes are stored in codes.json.
